## 🧠 About the Project

This project reflects the new technological reality we're witnessing: a world where artificial intelligence actively assists in the development process. The application was created using **AI-powered coding assistance** from [Replit](https://replit.com/), showcasing how such tools can enhance both learning and productivity.

> I personally don't believe AI will *replace* programmers — rather, it will **amplify their capabilities** and accelerate the learning curve.  
> Prompt engineering and controlling AI behavior is rapidly becoming a new skill set — one that is already relevant today.

This project demonstrates that being able to **communicate with AI** effectively is just as valuable as writing code itself.
